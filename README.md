# GPU-Gram-Scan
GPU Accelerated Gram Scan

implemet merge sort. realized want bitonic

figure out how bitonic works and make sutup of infra forcuda. set up cuda but still confused how will implement on gpu

figure out how to do on gpu with psudocode. get a good idea and now feel like fully understand algo, but do not know yet how to partition sorting network into blocks and threads

figure that out.  got a good idea also wrote some edge cases I need to look out for like non-power-of-2 and how to handle

implement everything but the kernels, getting blocka nd threads down.
